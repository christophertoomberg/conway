# Conway's Game of Life!

---> [Deployed here](https://conway.cht00m.vercel.app/) <---
> Read about the game here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

To run on your local machine:

#### Clone the project
~~~
git clone <project link>
~~~

#### Run a local server (eg. live-server)
~~~
live-server
~~~

That's it! Just open the link you got from the server in your favourite browser and enjoy.

If you like to watch the world burn, you can also just open the index.html file without running a local server.

### Further TODO's for this project


- [x] Fit the game nicely on screen
- [ ] Allow the user to draw with the mouse a starting shape
- [x] Deploy the game
- [ ] Make each cell an object to keep track of its state? + visualization
- [ ] Floating point instead of 0s and 1s
- [ ] Circles?
- [ ] Grid swapping for better performance, not creating a new instance every iteration
