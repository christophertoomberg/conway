# Conway's Game of Life!

To run on your local machine:

#### Clone the project
~~~
git clone <project link>
~~~

#### Run a local server (eg. live-server)
~~~
live-server
~~~

That's it! Just open the link you got from the server in your favourite browser and enjoy.

If you like to watch the world burn, you can also just open the index.html file without running a local server.
