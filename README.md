# Conway's Game of Life!

To run on your local machine:

#### Clone the project
~~~
git clone <project link>
~~~

#### Run a local server (eg. live-server)
~~~
live-server
~~~

That's it! Just open the link you got from live-server (usually http://127.0.0.1:8080/) in your favourite browser and enjoy.

If you like to watch the world burn, you can also just open the index.html file without running a local server.
